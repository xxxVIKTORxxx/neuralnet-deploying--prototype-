# neuralnet-deploying-[prototype]
Experimentations with NN deploying

>>> <b>[In Development]</b>

* Function for neuralnet variable drawing created

___
In plans:
* Deploy a reinforcement learning neuralnet
* Connect it with the drawn neuralnet for its working visualisation
* Add an epochs counts text somewhere
* Add loss and accuracy chart at left side somewhere
* Add timer for an agent's life-length equal like enough to move around perimeter of game-space-screen or twice
* [Optional] Make a game more challengeable
