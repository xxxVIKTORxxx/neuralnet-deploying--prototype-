>>> <b>[In Development]</b>

* Function for neuralnet's variables drawing created
* Scripted AI with AI control added (with NN control added too)
* Q-learning implemented based on the reloading of a best-scored model
* Charts drawing was realised
___
In plans:
* Connect it with the drawn neuralnet for its working visualisation [if there is any sense for that]
* [Optional] Make a game more challengeable
